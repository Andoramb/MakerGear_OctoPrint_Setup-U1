# OctoPrint-HelloPablo

**TODO:** Describe what your plugin does.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/MakerGear/MakerGear_OctoPrint_Setup/archive/master.zip

**TODO:** For now, it's as simple as going over to Downloads in Bitbucket, and downloading the .zip file.  You can then upload that directly in the Plugin Manager, More, Install from Uploaded section - OctoPrint will extract it all correctly.

## Configuration

**TODO:** Describe your plugin's configuration options (if any).
